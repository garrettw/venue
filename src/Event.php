/**
 * Event Class.
 *
 * Objects of this class will be passed, whenever an event is fired, to all
 * handlers of said event along with their results. This class also allows
 * event handlers to easily share information with other event handlers.
 *
 * Extend this class if you want to impose some sort of structure on the data
 * contained in your specific event type. You could validate the $data array or
 * add custom properties.
